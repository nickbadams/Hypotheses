# Hypotheses
Registering some hypotheses

Hello world,

I'm registering excerpts from an earlier dissertation draft that list some hypotheses. I showed these to my dissertation group on Feb 22nd. I'll upload the email at some point.

Here's from the text, which I haven't edited since then:

"HYPOTHESES – list along with Chapter where they are tested.
4:Lifecourses
5:Political opportunity Structures  contentious performances
6:Police factors: capacity, culture, demographics, training
7:Repression
8:Strategic and pro-active vs. Reactive (Strategic Interactions with goals of certification/de-certification) 
9:National influence vs. independent cities/police -- Are cities more than just the parts of the national sum??"

Later, in Chapter 3:

"Though topic modeling, requiring so little input from researchers, is surely a very inductive approach to the identification of contentious performances, it may be useful for a certain kind of hypothesis testing, the sine qua non of the deductive scientific approach. Writing, now, before I have seen output from topic models I make the following hypotheses:

1.	The performance of topic modeling on text units describing contentious gatherings will identify an array of contentious performances, including:
a.	Marches
b.	Demonstrations/Rallies
c.	Vigils
d.	Bank Transfer Days
e.	The People’s Microphone
f.	The Hostile Mic Check
g.	Port Blockades
h.	Sidewalk Blocking
i.	Bank Occupations
j.	Home Occupations
2.	"
